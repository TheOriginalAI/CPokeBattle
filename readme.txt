The pokemon C file is the code while the pokemon txt file is an ASCII image (it's needed for the code to work!).
The two .h files are also required. 

The game is text based with no real graphics and any ASCII in the files are not my own neither do I own the Pokemon franchise.
I do not know who owns/has created the poemon ascii in the txt file, but it was found on the ASCII Art Archive website.



This game was based on my other pokemon (written via assembly language) battle game. I wanted to add more features on said game, but
assembly language makes it tough with the amount of registers to swap around - so I made one in C!
I wanted to figure out how to add multiple pokemon (for the player) to choose from, but I am stuck on that aspect of the game. 


Have fun playing!
